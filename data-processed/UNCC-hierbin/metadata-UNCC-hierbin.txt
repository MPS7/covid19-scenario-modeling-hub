methods: Because of the complexity of socio-epidemiological system of COVID-19, we developed a statistical model to track and predict the cumulative case in 2021, assuming it follow certain asymptotic curves. We then projected cumulative case based on the developed model which served as the baseline scenario (no external processes such as changes in NPIs,  vaccination campaigns, new variant invasion, etc.). The difference of daily cumulative case would be the baseline incident case. In order to model various scenarios, we develop the following methodology. Vaccination was modeled as a time-dependent function to reduce incident case using the 2021 data when vaccines are administrated. Hospitalization was modeled as a binomial process of incident case and no overload of healthcare system was considered in 2021. Hospitalization rate was estimated as a function of vaccination rate (i.e., vaccination not only reduces incident case but also prevents severe disease prognosis that leads to hospitalization and death). We assumed that only severe condition patients required hospitalization (using in-patient data from HHS), and vaccination would reduce the prognosis from non-severe to severe. Similarly, death was modeled as a binomial process of hospitalization, assuming all deaths occurred in hospitalized patients in severe condition. Deaths in long-term care facility or at home were not considered. Death rate was also another function of vaccination rate. To model new variants (Delta and future variants), we assumed a homogeneous initial prevalence (based on assumptions of different scenarios) across all states (though this can be relaxed to reflect more specific state-level variation in prevalence of new variants). We modeled new variants as an exclusively competitive strain, where it would take over the entire COVID-19 strain "population" anywhere in 10-30 days (high variant) or 20-40 days (low variant), respectively. For the new variant in round #9, we assumed a uniform distribution of 30-70d invasion. Increased transmissibility is then modeled as a time-dependent function of the invasion of the new variant. The maximum increase would be capped at 20% (low transmissibility) or 60% (high transmissibility) when B1617 was the dominant strain (round #6, #7). For round #9, the maximum increase of transmissibility was 50% from the scenario (plus or minus a small percentage of jitter to account for state-level variation). In addition, during mixture time when the new variant had not taken over the entire host population, increased transmissibility would be modeled as a mixture of current strain (no change) and the new variant. Since cumulative curve tracks overal asymptotic behavior, it does not have the ability to incorporate (temporally) local events. To incorporate local events such as school opening and winter surge of cases, we use last year's case data to further calibrate local behavior of the model. Waning immunity is modeled as an exponential function with respective duration (e.g., 1-year or 3-year). We assume the suscpetible pool is still large enough, so increasing incidence is modeled as a function of rate of waning immunity. Loss of protection to hospitalization and death are also modeled as respective functions of waning immunity rates. For round #9, state-level child population was considered. Current state-level child vaccination rates were also used to model influence of upcoming vaccination scheme for 5-12yr. We assumed current vaccination would have the same effect on children as on adults, including reducing cases, reducing hospitalization, and reducing death. 

contact_tracing: NA
testing: NA
vaccine_efficacy_transmission: Efficacy of vaccine to reduce transmission was modeled as a state- and time-dependent function based on existing data in 2021.

vaccine_hesitancy: Vaccine hesitancy was implicitly modeled as an asympototic curve of vaccination rate in each state.
vaccine_immunity_duration: 0.5 year or 1 year, expotentially decay
natural_immunity_duration: For this project we assumed no leaking immunity from previous infection, i.e., much longer than 6mo.
