methods: The LOP ensemble projection is calculated by averaging cumulative probabilities of a given value across submissions. For each value, the highest and lowest probabilities are given zero weight and the remaining are weighted equally.  From the resulting distribution, medians and uncertainty intervals are derived. Ensemble projection includes only those submissions that reported quantiles for their targets.
